### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a professional software architect from [Georgia, Tbilisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi), my knowledge of technology includes a firm grasp of software engineering paradigms, deep understanding of the Python, Elixir, and C programming languages, deep understanding of: operating systems, memory management, threading and interrupts. Mainly I use Elixir, and currently I work as an Elixir back-end developer and I use technologies like GraphQL and CQRS to create scalable architectures.

I like to learn new technologies, mainly I like to learn new programming languages by making pet-projects in them, some of the pet projects turn out to be successfull and it motivates me to continue learning. Currently I am learning the Zig which is a quite interesting pre-1.0.0 programming language.

Open source enthusiast, developer and maintainer of the [Grip framework](https://github.com/grip-framework/grip), contributor to the Crystal programming language and an experienced cyber security analyst. I also enjoy searching around for new and interesting projects on GitHub specifically No-SQL key/value storages and web frameworks, C bindings, new programming languages, etc.
