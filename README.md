### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a professional software architect, I have a firm grasp of software engineering paradigms, deep understanding of the Python, Crystal, Elixir, C# and C programming languages.

Mainly I use Crystal and Elixir, currently I work as an Elixir back-end developer and I use technologies like GraphQL and CQRS to create scalable architectures.

Experience with GraphQL and Absinthe, Experience with multiple popular web-frameworks including:

- Japronto
- Vibora
- Express
- Django
- Flask
- Phoenix
- Amber
- Kemal

Open source enthusiast, developer and maintainer of the [Grip framework](https://github.com/grip-framework/grip), contributor to the Crystal programming language and an experienced cyber security analyst. I also enjoy searching around for new and interesting projects on GitHub specifically No-SQL key/value storages and web frameworks.
