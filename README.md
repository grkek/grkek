### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a professional software architect from [Georgia, Tbilisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi), my knowledge of technology includes a firm grasp of software engineering paradigms, a deep understanding of the Crystal, Elixir, and C programming languages, a deep understanding of operating systems, memory management, threading and interrupts. Mainly I use Crystal, and currently, I work as a Software Engineer.

I like to learn new technologies, mainly I like to learn new programming languages by making pet projects in them, some of the pet projects turn out to be successful and it motivates me to continue learning. Currently, I am maintaining my projects and working.

Open-source enthusiast, developer, and maintainer of the [Grip framework](https://github.com/grip-framework/grip), a contributor to the Crystal programming language, and an experienced cybersecurity analyst. I also enjoy searching around for new and interesting projects on GitHub specifically No-SQL key/value storages and web frameworks, C bindings, new programming languages, etc.
